# APScanner - README

## Overview
APScanner is a simple and efficient mobile application designed to scan and log MAC addresses from QR codes. It provides a seamless user experience for network professionals and enthusiasts who need quick access to MAC address data.

## Features

### **Scanning**
- When you open the app, you are prompted to begin scanning.
- Tap the scan button to open the QR code scanner.
- The scanner detects QR codes containing MAC addresses and displays the result.
- If the QR code does not contain a valid MAC address, the app will show **"Invalid Code"**.
- **Flash Toggle**: You can turn the flash on or off for better visibility in low-light conditions.
- **Zoom In & Out**: Swipe up to zoom in, swipe down to return to the default view.
- **Expandable Information Panel**: A white bar at the bottom can be expanded to full screen, pausing the camera and turning off the flash to conserve battery life while keeping the scanned MAC address visible.

### **Viewing Scan History**
- Switch to the **History** tab to see all your recent scans.
- Tap on any MAC address to **copy it to the clipboard**.
- **Clear History**: A button in the top right corner allows you to clear all saved scans. **Note:** Clearing history is irreversible.
